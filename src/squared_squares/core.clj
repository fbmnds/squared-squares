;(ns squared-squares.core)

;; Create a function of two integer arguments: the start and end, respectively.
;; You must create a vector of strings which renders a 45Â° rotated square of integers
;; which are successive squares from the start point up to and including the end point.
;; If a number comprises multiple digits, wrap them around the shape individually.
;; If there are not enough digits to complete the shape, fill in the rest with asterisk
;; characters. The direction of the drawing should be clockwise, starting from the center of
;; the shape and working outwards, with the initial direction being down and to the right.
